    <p style="margin:0px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:10px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.56;  font-size: 16px;  font-family:  HelveticaNeue; color: black;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hello! Here I will shortly tell you about myself. I was born in Bakırköy district of Istanbul. I'm 22 years old. I live in Küçükçekmece district of Istanbul. I like learning new things, reading, researching, coding and following technology. I completed my primary and secondary education at Behiye Selim Pars Secondary School. Then I started my high school life by winning Avcılar Vocational and Technical Anatolian High School. In the 10th grade, a department was selected according to the average. I chose the Department of Information Technologies because I am interested in this profession.</p>
           
           <p style="margin:0px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:10px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.56;  font-size: 16px;  font-family:  HelveticaNeue; color: black;">&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to the numerical courses I attended in high school, I focused on computer courses.After using MsSQL , C# , C++, HTML-CSS-JS programming languages as a beginner level, I started photo and video editing applications. After high school, I got the right to enter the Computer Technology and Information Systems department at Mersin University / Erdemli Applied Technology and Business School. I am a 3rd year student and still continuing my education. I am preparing myself for business life by improving my programming and coding knowledge that I learned at university and vocational high school. I am particularly interested in web and graphic design, mobile application development (flutter), embedded programming / robotics and cyber security applications.</p>

According to the user role I give to registered users, they can spend time on my blog. Users in the standard member role cannot share their own blogs, but can read previously shared author blogs. Users in the role of authors can both share their own content and follow previously shared content. The most important reason for my blog is to enrich my blog site in terms of content thanks to the articles shared by my users, who are in the role of authors, by benefiting from their extensive knowledge and experience.</p>

Because I know that the increase in visitors on blog sites is directly proportional to the income expectation. I currently do not earn any income from my blog site. I don't expect any income at the moment. After I become a popular blog site, I know that I will make a good income with the display ads, sponsored content and subscriptions I will put on my blog page. In addition, after I include Sales / Revenue partnership product and service sales on my blog site in order to increase my income over time, I will have exceeded my income expectation.</p>
