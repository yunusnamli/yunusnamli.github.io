          <p>About Me
Hello! Here I will shortly tell you about myself. I was born in Bakırköy district of Istanbul. I'm 22 years old. I live in Küçükçekmece district of Istanbul. I like learning new things, reading, researching, coding and following technology. I completed my primary and secondary education at Behiye Selim Pars Secondary School. Then I started my high school life by winning Avcılar Vocational and Technical Anatolian High School. In the 10th grade, a department was selected according to the average. I chose the Department of Information Technologies because I am interested in this profession.
In addition to the numerical courses I attended in high school, I focused on computer courses.After using MsSQL , C# , C++, HTML-CSS-JS programming languages as a beginner level, I started photo and video editing applications. After high school, I got the right to enter the Computer Technology and Information Systems department at Mersin University / Erdemli Applied Technology and Business School. I am a 3rd year student and still continuing my education. I am preparing myself for business life by improving my programming and coding knowledge that I learned at university and vocational high school. I am particularly interested in web and graphic design, mobile application development (flutter), embedded programming / robotics and cyber security applications.
In this section, I will talk about my goals and dreams for the future.
I determine my future goals in two ways. The first is short-term goals, the second is long-term goals.
My short term goals:
*Improve my English
*Developing .Net based projects.
* Writing blogs on my personal blog site.
* To do an internship in a place where I can develop myself in accordance with my field.
* Participating in certified courses related to my department.
* To conference my friends and teachers by inviting people who have knowledge about software at my school.
In my long-term goals, I want to be a good engineer who has developed myself in my field. I researched what I needed to do to reach this goal and determined my roadmap. First of all, I aim to graduate from university with a good GPA. I think that I will become a good engineer by getting a good career and improving myself in my field systematically and efficiently. In addition to being a good engineer, I would like to travel to many countries and work abroad in the future.
